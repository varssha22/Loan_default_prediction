# Loan Default Prediction – Lending Club Dataset  

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project focuses on predicting **loan defaults** using the **Lending Club dataset** from Kaggle, which contains **200,000+ rows** and **150+ features**.  
The goal was to perform **data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training**, followed by creating an **interactive dashboard in Power BI** for business insights.

## 🔧 Key Steps  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values through imputation.  
- Removed redundant/irrelevant features.  
- Addressed multicollinearity among variables.  
- Applied feature engineering to create meaningful variables.  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and outliers.  
- Identified key risk factors influencing loan default.  
- Summarized trends using graphs and pivot tables.  

### 3. Machine Learning Models  
Implemented and compared multiple models:  
- Logistic Regression (LR)  
- Decision Tree (DT)  
- Random Forest (RF)  
- XGBoost (XGB)  

📊 **Achieved 99% accuracy on the test set.**  

### 4. Dashboard – Power BI  
- Created an interactive dashboard to visualize loan data.  
- Included borrower profiles, loan performance trends, default risk factors, and key KPIs.  
- Made results accessible to business users for decision-making.

## 🚀 Results & Insights  
- XgBoost outperformed the other models with 99.85% Average CV score (Recall) and 100% Accuracy.  
- Top risk factors for default: interest rate, annual income, loan grade, debt-to-income ratio.  
- Business-friendly dashboard for monitoring loan performance and defaults.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation & reporting  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: EDA & experimentation

## 📈 Future Work  
- Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation.  
- Model deployment (Flask/Streamlit).  
- Integrating real-time data pipelines.
