# Loan Default Prediction – Lending Club Dataset
<h2> 📌 Project Overview </h2>

This project focuses on predicting loan defaults using the Lending Club dataset from Kaggle, which contains 200,000+ rows and 150+ features.
The goal was to build a machine learning pipeline that performs data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training, followed by creating an interactive dashboard in Power BI for business insights.

<h2>🔧 Key Steps</h2>
<h3>1. Data Preprocessing</h3>
<ul>
<li></li>Handled missing values through imputation.

<li>Removed redundant/irrelevant features.

<li>Addressed multicollinearity among variables.

<li>Applied feature engineering to create meaningful variables.
</ul>

<h3>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
<ul>

<li>Visualized distributions, correlations, and outliers.

<li>Identified key risk factors influencing loan default.

<li>Summarized trends using graphs and pivot tables.
</ul>

<h3>3. Machine Learning Models</h3>
<ul>

<h4>Implemented and compared multiple models:</h4>

<li>Logistic Regression (LR)

<li>Decision Tree (DT)

<li>Random Forest (RF)

<li>XGBoost (XGB)
</ul>

<h4>📊 Achieved 99% accuracy on the test set.</h4>

<h3>4. Dashboard – Power BI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Created an interactive dashboard to visualize loan data.

<li>Included borrower profiles, loan performance trends, default risk factors, and key KPIs.

<li>Made results accessible to business users for decision-making.
</ul>

<h2>🚀 Results & Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Logistic Regression outperformed the other models.

<li>Top risk factors for default: interest rate, annual income, loan grade, debt-to-income ratio.

<li>Business-friendly dashboard for monitoring loan performance and defaults.
</ul>

<h2>📊 Tools & Technologies</h2>
<ul>

<li><b>Python:</b> Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

<li><b>Power BI:</b> Dashboard creation & reporting

<li><b>Jupyter Notebook:</b> EDA & experimentation
</ul>

<h2>📈 Future Work</h2>
<ul>

<li>Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation.

<li>Model deployment (Flask/Streamlit).

<li>Integrating real-time data pipelines.
</ul>
